  <h1>Travel Blog: Qu√©bec City & Niagara Falls</h1>

  <p>
    In the summer of 2025, I embarked on a short but unforgettable journey to explore the beauty of Qu√©bec City and the majestic Niagara Falls. These iconic destinations offered a perfect blend of history, culture, and nature.
  </p>

  <h2>üìç Highlights of the Trip</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Visited Ch√¢teau Frontenac and wandered through Old Qu√©bec's charming streets.</li>
    <li>Took a breathtaking cruise near Niagara Falls ‚Äî and got completely soaked!</li>
    <li>Captured dozens of sunset views and city nightscapes.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>üì∏ A Memorable Moment</h2>
  <p>
    One of the most memorable moments was standing on the deck of the Maid of the Mist, completely surrounded by the thundering roar of the waterfalls. I could feel the mist on my face and the energy of nature all around me. It was powerful and humbling.
  </p>

  <h2>üó∫Ô∏è Reflections</h2>
  <p>
    Traveling to these two places reminded me of how refreshing it is to step away from daily routines and embrace new environments. I look forward to exploring more cities and natural wonders in the future.
